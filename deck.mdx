## **by 2002:** a new commodity market became available in Botswana, Ghana, and Uganda, which was:

- highly liquid
- broadly accepted
- authenticated

```notes

what were the properties of this commodity that brought this to bear?
```

"They would purchase a ticket in, say, the capital city, and text the code to their upcountry relatives. The relatives could choose to either put the code on their phone and gain airtime, or sell the airtime on to friends or merchants. This spontaneous use of airtime as a currency, with no outside or external civil society influence, suggested to us a huge pent-up demand for financial services, particularly the transfer of money within the country."

# An alternative view of "financial services"

- secure(r) savings systems
- inflation-resistant value stores
- "mutual insurance", i.e., community resilience
- remittances (especially internationally)

we are not talking about subprime mortgages
we are not talking about wall street
we are not talking about tax "optimization" (evasion)

### Gamos study (2003) found phone usage to be a major facilitator of local financial services

---

## via Institute of Development Studies review

### "Forty-five per cent of respondents stated they ‚Äòuse phone calls to discuss financial matters‚Äô."

S. Batchelor (2012)

"The more desired product would be a system that fully retained the cash in value of the registered electronic money.
We also considered whether international and domestic remittances could work together to strengthen livelihoods. We discovered that the global average flow of international remittances was $120 billion but that the average transaction cost for this was said to be 12 per cent. We were shocked ‚Äì this felt like an unnecessary and unfair tax on migrants."

# M-Pesa

an international mobile-phone based money system

(initially launched in Kenya, now spread internationally)

---

# Kinds of players in M-Pesa

- Safaricom: administrator and trust authority
- Agents: independent, but registered, to deposit & withdraw
- Users: can use their phone number to send/receive the currency

---

**2007**: launch

**2009**: 8M monthly active users

**2014**: at least 40% of Kenya's GDP moves in M-Pesa

**2016**: 1.7B in remittances to Kenya (M-Pesa and others)

**2018**: 20M mau, 100k active agents

---

## Finaccess Survey (2009)
### "50 percent of M-Pesa users report that they would like to receive their main income by M-Pesa, mainly due to speed and accessibility."

"they preferred [to pay a significant mark-up] to investing in a higher value card of their own for future use ‚Äì the main stated reason for this being that the available denominations were too large." 

```notes
one helpful observation (but not the whole story)
this remark indicates that these developing markets primarily need small-quantity transactions
Finaccess: assessed typical transactions under 2500 Ksh;

M-Pesa: 28 Ksh / Tx

"Bitcoin‚Äôs biggest problem is not even its massive energy consumption, but that the network is mostly fueled by coal-fired power plants in China. Coal-based electricity is available at very low rates in this country. Even with a conservative emission factor, this results in an extreme carbon footprint for each unique Bitcoin transaction.

Additional research published in Nature Climate Change (October 2018) even suggested that Bitcoin mining alone could push global warming ‚Äúabove 2 ¬∞C within less than three decades‚Äú."

Key takeaways:

1. Developing markets are primarily concerned with financial access
2. High likelihood of phone owners compared to computer owners
3. Dangers of centrally administered economy increases abroad
4. Yet, decentralized operating costs must compete with provider fees
5. Decentralized system should not make Earth uninhabitable

now, you were promised a tech talk
everything you've heard is to contextualize costs

Today's lemma:

## In a cryptocurrency protocol, block agreement is the current leading energy cost.

```notes
in other words, the efficiency of a blockchain technology depends on its ability to accomplish global consensus.
and here, there is hope.
