what were the properties of this commodity that brought this to bear?
```

"They would purchase a ticket in, say, the capital city, and text the code to their upcountry relatives. The relatives could choose to either put the code on their phone and gain airtime, or sell the airtime on to friends or merchants. This spontaneous use of airtime as a currency, with no outside or external civil society influence, suggested to us a huge pent-up demand for financial services, particularly the transfer of money within the country."

# An alternative view of "financial services"

- secure(r) savings systems
- inflation-resistant value stores
- "mutual insurance", i.e., community resilience
- remittances (especially internationally)

```notes
we are not talking about subprime mortgages
we are not talking about wall street
we are not talking about tax "optimization" (evasion)

### Gamos study (2003) found phone usage to be a major facilitator of local financial services

---

## via Institute of Development Studies review

### "Forty-five per cent of respondents stated they ‚Äòuse phone calls to discuss financial matters‚Äô."

S. Batchelor (2012)

"The more desired product would be a system that fully retained the cash in value of the registered electronic money.
We also considered whether international and domestic remittances could work together to strengthen livelihoods. We discovered that the global average flow of international remittances was $120 billion but that the average transaction cost for this was said to be 12 per cent. We were shocked ‚Äì this felt like an unnecessary and unfair tax on migrants."

# M-Pesa

an international mobile-phone based money system

(initially launched in Kenya, now spread internationally)

---

# Kinds of players in M-Pesa

- Safaricom: administrator and trust authority
- Agents: independent, but registered, to deposit & withdraw
- Users: can use their phone number to send/receive the currency

---

**2007**: launch

**2009**: 8M monthly active users (m.a.u)

**2014**: at least 40% of Kenya's GDP moves in M-Pesa

**2016**: 1.7B in remittances to Kenya (M-Pesa and others)

**2018**: 20M m.a.u., 100k active agents

---

## Finaccess Survey (2009)
### "50 percent of M-Pesa users report that they would like to receive their main income by M-Pesa, mainly due to speed and accessibility."

## 2. requires government ID

```notes
brief rest:
- We've seen emergent mobile micropayments
- also, businesses trying to meet the need
- m-pesa seems outmoded, but is still popular
- what happened to bitcoin in all this? it is clearly simialr in goals to Bitcoin, minus decentralizion
```

---

# Net cost to operate Bitcoin is orders of magnitude more than cost of operating a centralized system.

---

# Is this really the "price of trust"?

```notes
this is a common myth about bitcoin
```

---

Remaining discussion: how can we create trust in decentralized systems?

1. Bitcoin's Nakamoto consensus
2. Democoin Consensus (working our way up to...)
3. Algorand's BA*


```notes
and here, there is hope.
